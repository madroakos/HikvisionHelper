# HikvisionHelper

Companion for Hikvision exported video files.  

Hikvision recorders often produce files with errors during export. This program is designed to fix these issues.


## Requirements

#### FFmpeg

I suggest using [Chocolatey](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco) for the installation of FFmpeg as it ensures proper configuration of PATH variables. Alternatively, you may opt to download it from [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg).
